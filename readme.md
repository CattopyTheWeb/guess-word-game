# Guess the Word game
#
A fun game to play when your bored and want to pass the time.
#
# **How to set it up?**
1. Have python installed - if you don't then get it at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version. And follow the installer's promps until your done.
2. Then open the [guessword.py](https://github.com/CattopyTheWeb/guess-word-game/guessword.py) and write in your own anwsers in the words variable or keep the defaults.
3. Run and enjoy!

Note: If you have guessed the word correctly type the word fully. That's one kwerk of the code (if anyone knows a better way of doing it please make a pull request and I'll be happy to merge it)
